# Installation
- Copy the "checksum" folder inside your FileRun installation folder's "customizables/plugins" folder.
- Open FileRun's control panel, add your preferred hashing algorithm under "Files" -> "Plugins" -> "Checksum" -> "Hashing algorithm"
- You might need to clear your browser's cache to see the new "Open with.." option. (Simply press Ctrl+F5 works for me)
